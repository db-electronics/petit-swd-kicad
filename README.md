# Petit SWD
Petit SWD is an ARM JTAG adapter which reduces the 2x10 100mil connector to a 1x4 100mil connector better suited for SWD debugging. It also has a type B USB input to provide power to the target board from either VBUS 5V or 3.3V from an onboard voltage regulator. This is selectable via pin header.
